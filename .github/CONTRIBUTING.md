# Cloning, building and running the project

Step by step:

* Clone this (or your fork's) repository via your IDE or command-line. (git clone https://github.com/<organization or
  user\>/\<repository/project name\>.git)
* Run ./gradlew build from your terminal to build the JAR for the project. Copy the generated JAR file at
  build/libs/DarkUtils-version.jar to your mods folder (make sure to get the jar that **does not** end with
  -sources.jar - that's the source code, not the binary). You should be able to run your game normally afterwards to
  test your changes in the mod.
